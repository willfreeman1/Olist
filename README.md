## Overview
This repository contains the essential files for an R-Shiny application developed as part of my R-Shiny project for the NYC Data Science Academy. The included files are the core scripts required to run the application and a selection of key data analyses that highlight the project's findings and methodology.

## Contents
- `FinalApp/global.R`: Global variables and setup script for the Shiny application.
- `FinalApp/server.R`: Server logic for the Shiny application.
- `FinalApp/ui.R`: User interface definitions for the Shiny application.
- `Scripts/data_prep2.Rmd`: Data preparation and initial analysis script.
